__doc__ = """Merge clusters according to overlap in contigs.

This module is obsolete in the current version of Vamb, as VAMB now creates
disjoint clusters. We have retained it here because in the future, it might be
of interest to return to producing overlapping clusters to improve accuracy
and/or speed up clustering.

This module contains four merging functions, of which one is commented out
because it requires the python-igraph package. For all functions, the set of
clusters are converted to a graph with each vertex being a cluster and two
clusters are connected with an edge if the intersection of contigs divided
by the smaller clusters exceeds a threshold.

The four merging functions are:

community_merge: (commented out, requires python-igraph):
    Merges nodes which form a community according to walktrap algorithm

clique_merge:
    Merges all maximal cliques as new clusters. Note that this may increase
    rather than reduce the number of clusters.

subgraph_merge:
    Merges sets of nodes which form a connected subgraph

hierarchical_merge:
    Merges pairs of nodes together from most to least connected
