## Parameters for the pipeline
# These are the recommended parameters used for the pipeline.
# --
# This is the minium size of the contigs used. Contigs smaller than this size are filtered away
min_contig_len: "2000"
# Pass in arguments here to extend the vamb call in the pipeline
plamb_params: " -o C "
# Pass in commands here to run before vamb is run in the pipeline
plamb_preload: ""
# These are parameters for node2vec which is used in the pipeline
n2v_ed: "32"
n2v_wl: "10"
n2v_ws: "10"
n2v_p: "0.1"
n2v_q: "2.0"
n2v_nz: "weight"
n2v_nw: "50"

# Other parameters
neighs_r: "0.1"
max_insert_size_circ: "50"
genomad_thr: "0.75"
# Use cuda for the vamb part of the pipeline. Uncomment to use cuda
# cuda: "True"

## Default resources
# This is the default resources used by the different rules
# If no specific resources are defined for a rule, these will be used.
# If these exceed the resources available they will be scaled down to match the hardware available. 
# See https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#resources for reference
default_walltime: "48:00:00"
default_threads: 16
default_mem_gb: 50

## Specific rule resources
# Below is the specific resources defined for the various rules in the pipeline 
# If no specific resources are defined for a rule, the default will be used instead.
